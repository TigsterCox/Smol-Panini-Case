# Smol-Panini-Case
The Smol-Panini-Case is a SlimeVR Smol-Slime Case using a integrated Filament hinge.

These cases have some intentionally tight tollerances on the hinges so that they are sufficiently stiff to assist with keeping the lid closed during use.
You can use a 2mm alankey or drill bit to make sure the gap is sufficient.
This case is intended to be used with 30mm straps.

Things you will need:

 - Stacked Slime with 601230 180mah battery and button of choice (i used 3X6X2.5 button)
 - Case.stl
 - Lid.stl
 - 38-40mm of filament (per case)
 - Allen key (optional)
 - Something hot (solding iron set to the temp you print at is perfect)

I would reccomend printing these out of PLA+, PETG or *proper* ABS @ 0.1mm layer height (0.2 is fine but doesnt look as nice).

DONT FORGET TO MAKE SURE THE LID IS UPSIDE DOWN FOR PRINTING 

After printing out the case & lid ammount you need start by lining up the hinge of the case and lid. 
(you can use the allen key or a 2nd peice of filament from the other end to help with this)

Next, push your peice of filament though till you have 1mm-2mm sticking out the other side.
Next, leaving 1mm-2mm of length, cut the extra filament off.

Using your "something hot" melt and flatten the ends of the filahinge (patent pending) to the case, this will prevent it from sliding out over time.

After you have done this, give it a couple flippy flops opening and closing it.
This will just help loosen it up abit, dont worry about it getting loose too much, if you're opening it often, you're doing something wrong.
